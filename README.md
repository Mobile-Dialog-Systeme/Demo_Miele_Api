## create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## activate the virtual environment

On Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```

> ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Many popular IDEs, such as VS Code and PyCharm, allow you to select the Python interpreter associated with your virtual environment. Doing so will automatically activate the environment for you when you open the project or run scripts.
## install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## update depencendies

If you do not want to update the dependencies manually, you can use the following command to update the requirements.txt file.
(But it will also write the dependencies of the installed packages, so you may want to remove the unnecessary ones)

```bash 
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
